Applying and Testing Data Structures

Part A of project: Data Structures

Write a class with methods that decide if a given a word is a palindrome, a word that can be read the same forward and backward. 
For example, the words “noon”, “racecar”, and “mom” are palindromes. 

Expand the functionality of this class by giving it the ability to find generalized palindromes. 
For example, the word “flake” is an off-by-one palindrome. 
If we forgive differences between characters that are 1 away in the alphabet, it reads the same when read forward and backward (‘f’ and ‘e’, and ‘k’ and ‘l’ are one away from each other).
